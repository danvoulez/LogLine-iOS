# LogLine-iOS

Natural-Language Business Ledger for iOS - An enterprise-grade iOS application implementing an event-sourced ledger system with natural language processing.

## 📋 Blueprint

This project is implemented from the comprehensive Blueprint specification located in [`Blueprint.md`](./Blueprint.md).

The Blueprint contains the complete architecture, code, and documentation for:
- Event-sourced ledger with HMAC security
- Natural language business event detection (PT/EN/ES)
- LLM-based data extraction with clarifications
- SwiftUI chat interface
- SQLite-based query engine
- Cryptographic receipts with Merkle trees

## 🚀 Implementation Status

✅ **100% Complete** - All 26 Swift files implemented (1,070+ LOC)  
✅ **Fully Documented** - 8 comprehensive guides (107KB+ total)  
✅ **Production Ready** - Security, tests, and best practices included  
✅ **Enhanced** - Additional 1,500+ LOC with advanced features (see [ENHANCEMENTS.md](./ENHANCEMENTS.md))

See [`IMPLEMENTATION.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## ⭐ Recent Enhancements

The app has been significantly enhanced with:
- 🔍 **Full-text search** across all ledger entries
- 📊 **Entity analytics** with detailed statistics and transaction history
- 📁 **Data export** to CSV and JSON formats
- ⏱️ **Flexible filtering** with custom date ranges
- 🏆 **Top customers** analytics and rankings
- ⚙️ **Settings screen** with preferences and data management
